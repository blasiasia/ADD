# Audio Deepfake Detection (ADD) - Voice Fish Team

Welcome to the GitHub repository for **Audio Deepfake Detection (ADD)**, a project by the **Voice Fish** team. This repository provides resources, code, and datasets related to detecting spoofed audio generated by advanced Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems.

## Abstract

Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech (TTS) has emerged as a breakthrough in speech synthesis, enabling high-quality voice generation with minimal data. This study addresses the challenges of detecting spoofed audio generated by Zero-Shot TTS systems. To tackle this, we propose a novel dataset, called **Voice Fish Tank Dataset**, and evaluate its performance against existing open datasets using models such as **RawNet2** and **SE-Res2Net**.

Our findings demonstrate that training models on diverse spoof audio sets, leveraging State-of-the-Art (SOTA) speech synthesis technologies, significantly enhances detection of Zero-Shot TTS-based spoofing, the most critical threat today. Furthermore, we show that high-quality datasets featuring diverse speakers and advanced synthesis methods can boost Deepfake audio detection performance without requiring changes to model architectures.

## Repository Overview

This repository focuses on **audio Deepfake detection models** and provides the following resources:

1. **Detection Models**: Code and configurations for models like **RawNet2** and **SE-Res2Net** used in our experiments.
2. **Voice Fish Tank Dataset**: A novel dataset specifically designed for training and evaluating audio Deepfake detection systems.
3. **Scripts and Utilities**: Tools for preprocessing, training, and evaluating detection models.

## Dataset Creation

During the development of the **Voice Fish Tank Dataset**, we employed multiple Zero-Shot TTS systems and advanced speech synthesis models. While this repository provides the dataset and detection model code, details and code for certain TTS models used during dataset creation are available in another GitHub repository.
